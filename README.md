# Escape Room
 This was a project that I programmed in my Computer Programming Class.

 It simulates a person stuck on an island and requires the user to enter in commands in the
 console to escape the island. The player can move to different places and interact with
 their surroundings.

 List of available commands:
 quit,
 look,
 move,
 check inventory // inventory,
 grab tool // pickup tool,
 drop tool,
 grab leaves // pickup leaves,
 collect wood // gather wood,
 grab key // pickup key,
 open safe // unlock safe,
 add leaves // add kindling,
 add wood,
 light fire // start fire,
 open cave // unblock cave,
 light torch,
 start boat,
 examine firepit,
 examine safe,
 examine toolbox,

 This is one of the first projects that I have programmed.
